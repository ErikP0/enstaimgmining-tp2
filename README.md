The modified notebook containing the new model and evaluation is [TP_2.ipynb](/TP_2.ipynb).

- `resX` is the pickled dictionary containing the parameters and loss histories of run `#X`
- `netX` is the pickled best performing model of run `#X`

Note that run #3 is split into the best-performing parameter tuple (`res3_top`/`net3_top`) and the rest (`res3_rest`/`net3_rest`).
